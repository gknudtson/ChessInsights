        <h1>About ChessInsights</h1>
        <p>ChessInsights is a Python-powered chess engine that utilizes bitboards to efficiently
            calculate valid moves.
            Currently, when playing against it, it selects a random move from a list of all valid
            moves in the position.
            However, I'm working towards building a more powerful evaluation system for better move
            selection.

    <h2>How It Works: A High-Level Technical Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This chess engine is designed around efficient bitboard representations and immutable board
        states to support fast move generation, rule enforcement, and game state evaluation. The
        following sections break down the key components:
    </p>

    <h3>Core Data Structures</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Board Representation:</strong> The engine uses a 64‚Äêbit integer <a
            href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Bitboards" target="_blank">(bitboard)</a> to
        represent the chess
        board, where each bit corresponds to a square. The overall game state is encapsulated in an
        immutable <code>BoardState</code> object which includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>piece_locations:</strong> A mapping from each piece type to its corresponding
            bitboard.
        </li>
        <li><strong>is_whites_turn:</strong> A flag indicating the current player.</li>
        <li><strong>en_passant_square:</strong> A bitboard indicating en passant targets.</li>
        <li><strong>fifty_move_rule:</strong> A counter for the 50-move draw rule.</li>
        <li><strong>move_number:</strong> A counter of the moves played.</li>
        <li><strong>castling_rights:</strong> Encoded rights for castling for both sides.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Move Generation</h3>
    <p>
        The engine employs bitboard operations to generate moves for each piece type:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pawns:</strong> Generate single and double moves, capture moves (including en
            passant) and handle promotions.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sliding Pieces (Rook, Bishop, Queen):</strong> Utilizes <a
                href="https://www.chessprogramming.org/Magic_Bitboards#How_it_works"
                target="_blank">magic
            bitboards</a> to efficiently generate all moves for sliding pieces in any position.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Knights:</strong> Utilize jump masks for their unique L-shaped movement.</li>
        <li><strong>Kings:</strong> Generate moves while ensuring that moves do not leave the king
            in check. Special castling moves are handled separately.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Move Execution and Rule Enforcement</h3>
    <p>
        <code>ChessBoard</code> is responsible for move validation and updating the
        <code>BoardState</code>. The <code>move_piece()</code> method is responsible for executing
        moves. It:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Validates the move against the current board state.</li>
        <li>Updates the bitboards to reflect piece movement and captures.</li>
        <li>Handles special moves such as castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.</li>
        <li>Simulates moves to ensure that the king does not remain in check.</li>
        <li>Updates <code>BoardState</code> variables to ensure game state is updated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Game State Evaluation</h3>
    <p>
        The server continuously evaluates the game state to detect conditions like checkmate,
        stalemate, and draw by the 50-move rule (as well as other draw conditions). This ensures
        that the game terminates correctly when one of these conditions is met.
    </p>

    <h3>Engine and Move Generation</h3>
    <p>
        An integrated engine component leverages the move generation logic from
        <code>ChessBoard</code> to select random legal
        moves from the list of valid moves, providing a simple AI opponent.
    </p>

    <h3>PGN and FEN Handling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>FEN:</strong> The engine parses FEN strings to initialize board states and
            serializes board states back into FEN format. This allows for efficient passing of
            information between the server and client.
        </li>
        <li><strong>PGN:</strong> Moves are converted into standard algebraic notation for human
            readability and game recording. PGN is also utilized to create buttons that allow
            players to view previous board states in the game.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Web API Integration</h3>
    <p>
        The engine is wrapped in a Flask-based web API, allowing users to interact with the game via
        HTTP requests. Endpoints are available for moving pieces, generating engine moves, undoing
        moves, and setting up new games.
